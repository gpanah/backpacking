**Telescoping vs Folding vs Fixed:**
- Based on [Switchback Travel](https://www.switchbacktravel.com/best-trekking-poles#buying-advice), telescoping seems like the best way to go.


**Shaft Materials (carbon or aluminum):** 
- Carbon lighter, higher end, but more brittle and when it breaks, can't use it.  Aluminum more forgiving.

**Locking mechanism (twist vs. lever):**
- Lever generally preferred.

**Grip construction (cork, foam, rubber)**
- Based on [Switchback Travel](https://www.switchbacktravel.com/best-trekking-poles#buying-advice), cork, then foam, then rubber.
